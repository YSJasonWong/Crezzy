	<h5 style="padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;">
		Welcome to the Expedia.com website (the "Website").<br> This Website is provided solely to assist customers in gathering travel information, determining the availability of travel—related goods and services, making legitimate reservations or otherwise transacting business with travel suppliers, and for no other purposes.<br> The terms "we", "us", "our", “Expedia” and "Expedia, Inc." refer to Expedia, Inc., a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries and corporate affiliates, including Travelscape, LLC, (collectively, the "Expedia Companies").<br> “Expedia Partner” means any co-branded and/or linked website through which we provide links, content or service. <br>The term "you" refers to the customer visiting the Website and/or booking a reservation through us on this Website, or through our customer service agents.<br>This Website is offered to you conditioned upon your acceptance without modification of all the terms, conditions, and notices set forth below (collectively, the "Terms of Use” or "Agreement").<br> Please read these Terms of Use carefully, as they contain important information about limitations of liability and resolution of disputes through arbitration rather than in court.<br> You should also read our <a href="policy.html" style="text-decoration:none;" alt="Privacy Policy" title="Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a>, which also governs your use of the Website, and is incorporated by reference in this Agreement.<br> By accessing or using this Website, booking any reservations for travel products or services on this Website, or contacting our call center agents, you agree that the Terms of Use then in force shall apply.<br> If you do not agree to the Terms of Use, please do not use or book any reservations through this Website or our call center agents.<br>
	</h5>
	
	<h3 style="color:#3F005F;padding-left:200px;">USE OF THE WEBSITE<br></h3>
	
	<h5 style="padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;">
		As a condition of your use of this Website, you warrant that:<br>
		1. you are at least 18 years of age;<br>
		2. you possess the legal authority to create a binding legal obligation;<br>
		3. you will use this Website in accordance with these Terms of Use;<br>
		4. you will only use this Website to make legitimate reservations for you or for another person for whom you are legally authorized to act;<br>
		5. you will inform such other persons about the Terms of Use that apply to the reservations you have made on their behalf, including all rules and restrictions applicable thereto;<br>
		6. all information supplied by you on this Website is true, accurate, current and complete; and<br>
		7. if you have an Expedia.com account, you will safeguard your account information and will supervise and be completely responsible for any use of your account by you and anyone other than you.<br>
		We retain the right at our sole discretion to deny access to anyone to this Website and the services we offer, at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited to, for violation of these Terms of Use.<br>
	</h5>
	
	<h3 style="color:#3F005F;padding-left:200px;">DISPUTES<br></h3>
	
	<h5 style="padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;">
		Expedia is committed to customer satisfaction, so if you have a problem or dispute, we will try to resolve your concerns. But if we are unsuccessful, you may pursue claims as explained in this section.<br><br>You agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any disputes or claims relating in any way to the Website, any dealings with our customer service agents, any services or products provided, any representations made by us, or our Privacy Policy (“Claims”) by contacting Expedia Customer Support or 1-877-787-7186. If we are not able to resolve your Claims within 60 days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set forth below. <br><br>
		Any and all Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except you may assert Claims on an individual basis in small claims court if they qualify. This includes any Claims you assert against us, our subsidiaries, travel suppliers or any companies offering products or services through us (which are beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement). This also includes any Claims that arose before you accepted these Terms of Use, regardless of whether prior versions of the Terms of Use required arbitration. <br><br>
		There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including statutory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs), and must follow and enforce these Terms of Use as a court would. <br><br>
		Arbitrations will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA Consumer Rules. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, except as provided in this section. If your total Claims seek less than $10,000, we will reimburse you for filing fees you pay to the AAA and will pay arbitrator’s fees. You may choose to have an arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the state where you live or at another mutually agreed location. <br><br>
		To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your Claims to “Expedia Legal: Arbitration Claim Manager,” at Expedia, Inc., 333 108th Ave N.E. Bellevue, WA 98004. If we request arbitration against you, we will give you notice at the email address or street address you have provided. The AAA's rules and filing instructions are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.<br><br>
		Any and all proceedings to resolve Claims will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. An arbitration decision may be confirmed by any court with competent jurisdiction. <br><br>

	<h3 style="color:#3F005F;padding-left:200px;">PRIVACY POLICY<br></h3>
	
	<h5 style="padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;">
		Expedia Inc. believes in protecting your privacy. Please click here to review our current Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Website and, as stated above, is incorporated by reference, to understand our practices: <a href="policy.html" title="Privacy Policy" style="text-decoration:none;" alt="Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a>.<br>
	</h5>
	
	<h3 style="color:#3F005F;padding-left:200px;">SUPPLIER RULES AND RESTRICTIONS<br></h3>
	
	<h5 style="padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;">
		<strong>Additional terms and conditions will apply to your reservation and purchase of travel—related goods and services that you select.</strong> Please read these additional terms and conditions carefully. In particular, if you have purchased an airfare, please ensure you read the full terms and conditions of carriage issued by the travel supplier, which can be found on the supplier’s website. You agree to abide by the terms and conditions of purchase imposed by any supplier with whom you elect to deal, including, but not limited to, payment of all amounts when due and compliance with the supplier's rules and restrictions regarding availability and use of fares, products, or services. Airfare is only guaranteed once the purchase has been completed and the tickets have been issued. Airlines and other travel suppliers may change their prices without notice. We reserve the right to cancel your booking if full payment is not received in a timely fashion.<br><br>
		Expedia may offer you the opportunity to book a reservation for a combination of two one—way tickets instead of a roundtrip ticket. Combined one-way tickets may provide a greater choice of flights, are often cheaper and can be combined on the same airline or on different airlines. Unlike roundtrip tickets, each one-way ticket is subject to its own rules, restrictions, and fees. If one of these flights is affected by an airline change (e.g. cancellation or rescheduling) that causes a Customer to make changes to the other flight, the Customer will be responsible for any fees incurred for making changes to the unaffected flight. <br><br>
		For certain low-cost carriers, the price of your flight has been converted from a different currency for convenience purposes to provide you an estimate of the amount of the purchase in your local currency. As a result, when you book, the amount charged to your credit card by the airline may be slightly different due to currency fluctuations. Your statement may also include a fee from your card issuer to process the transaction plus any applicable taxes for international purchases.<br><br>
		Federal law forbids the carriage of hazardous materials aboard aircraft in your luggage or on your person. A violation can result in five years' imprisonment and penalties of $250,000 or more (49 U.S.C. 5124). Hazardous materials include explosives, compressed gases, flammable liquids and solids, oxidizers, poisons, corrosives and radioactive materials. Examples: Paints, lighter fluid, fireworks, tear gases, oxygen bottles, and radio-pharmaceuticals. There are special exceptions for small quantities (up to 70 ounces total) of medicinal and toilet articles carried in your luggage and certain smoking materials carried on your person.<br><br>
		You acknowledge that some third-party providers offering certain services and/or activities may require you to sign their liability waiver prior to participating in the service and/or activity they offer. You understand that any violation of any such supplier's rules and restrictions may result in cancellation of your reservation(s), in your being denied access to the applicable travel product or services, in your forfeiting any monies paid for such reservation(s), and/or in our debiting your account for any costs we incur as a result of such violation. <br><br>
		Expedia is not liable for any costs incurred due to hotel relocation.<br><br>

	<h3 style="color:#3F005F;padding-left:200px;">Sort Order :<br></h3>
	
	<h5 style="padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;">
		Travelers have many options on to help them find the perfect hotel, flight, car rental, cruise or activity. The “sort” settings at the top of the page allows travelers to order search results to their preference, whether based on price, verified review score, or other criteria. The “filter” settings also allow travelers to include or exclude various options to suit their travel needs. If no options are selected, we will show a range of relevant options in the search results, based on the criteria outlined below:<br><br>
		Lodging: Our default sort order reflects the relevance of properties to your search criteria, as we want to make sure you are able to quickly and easily find the offer that is right for you. We measure relevance by taking into account factors like a property’s location, its review scores, the popularity of the property (measured by how many travelers on our sites make bookings at that property), the quality of the content provided by the property, and the competitiveness of the property’s rates and availability, all relative to other properties meeting your chosen search criteria. The compensation which a property pays us for bookings made through our sites is also a factor for the relative ranking of properties with similar offers, based on the relevance factors described above. On our non-default sorts (e.g., by price or by star rating), properties with similar results will be ordered based on the factors above.<br>
		Flights: Our default sort order is based on lowest price. In cases where two flights have the same price, the shorter flight is listed first.<br>
		Car Rental: Our default sort order is primarily driven by price, but we may consider other relevant factors such as popularity, customer reviews, convenience of pickup location, and car type or category.<br>
		Cruise: Our default sort order is based on a number of relevant factors such as cruise line rating, ship rating, price per day, origin rating, destination rating, length of cruise, and booking window.<br>
		Activities: Our default sort order is manually curated by Expedia’s destination managers familiar with each market, taking into account such factors as price, popularity, distance from hotel options, and traveler feedback.<br>
		Vacation Packages: When combining several different travel products into a vacation package, we use the criteria outlined above to determine the sort order for each product.<br><br>
		Additionally, we continually optimize our service to provide the best experience to travelers. Accordingly, we may test different default sort order algorithms from time to time. <br><br>

	<h3 style="color:#3F005F;padding-left:200px;">PREPAID HOTEL RESERVATIONS<br></h3>
	
	<h5 style="padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;">
		You acknowledge that the Expedia Companies pre-negotiate certain room rates with hotel suppliers to facilitate the booking of reservations. You also acknowledge that the Expedia Companies provide you services to facilitate such booking of reservations for a consideration (the "facilitation fee"). The room rate displayed on the Website is a combination of the pre-negotiated room rate for rooms reserved on your behalf by the Expedia Companies and the facilitation fee retained by the Expedia Companies for their services. You authorize the Expedia Companies to book reservations for the total reservation price, which includes the room rate displayed on the Website, plus tax recovery charges, service fees, and where applicable, taxes on the Expedia Companies' services. You agree that your credit card will be charged by the Expedia Companies for the total reservation price. Upon submitting your reservation request you authorize the Expedia Companies, including Travelscape, LLC, to facilitate hotel reservations on your behalf, including making payment arrangements with hotel suppliers.<br><br>
		You acknowledge that except as provided below with respect to tax obligations on the amounts we retain for our services, the Expedia Companies do not collect taxes for remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The tax recovery charges on prepaid hotel transactions are a recovery of the estimated taxes (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, etc.) that the Expedia Companies pay to the hotel supplier for taxes due on the hotel's rental rate for the room. The hotel suppliers invoice the Expedia Companies for certain charges, including tax amounts. The hotel suppliers are responsible for remitting applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions. None of the Expedia Companies act as co-vendors with the supplier with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location. The actual tax amounts paid by the Expedia Companies to the hotel suppliers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual use of the hotel by our customers. We retain service fees as additional compensation in servicing your travel reservation. Service fees retained by the Expedia Companies for their services vary based on the amount and type of hotel reservation. <br><br>
		You may cancel or change your prepaid hotel reservation, but you will be charged the cancellation or change fee indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. If you do not cancel or change your reservation before the cancellation policy period applicable to the hotel you reserved, which varies by hotel (usually 24 to 72 hours) prior to your date of arrival, you will be subject to a charge equal to applicable nightly rates, tax recovery charges and service fees. In the event you do not show for the first night of the reservation and plan to check-in for subsequent nights in your reservation, you must confirm the reservation changes with us no later than the date of the first night of the reservation to prevent cancellation of your reservation. <br><br>
		You agree to pay any cancellation or change fees that you incur. In limited cases, some hotels do not permit changes to or cancellations of reservations after they are made, as indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. You agree to abide by the Terms of Use imposed with respect to your prepaid hotel reservations. <br><br>
		Sales, use and/or local hotel occupancy taxes are imposed on the amounts that we charge for our services (service fee and/or facilitation fee) in certain jurisdictions. The actual tax amounts on our services may vary depending on the rates in effect at the time of your hotel stay.<br><br>
		You may not book reservations for more than 8 rooms online for the same hotel/stay dates. If we determine that you have booked reservations for more than 8 rooms in total in separate reservations, we may cancel your reservations, and charge you a cancellation fee, if applicable. If you paid a non-refundable deposit, your deposit will be forfeited. If you wish to book reservations for 9 or more rooms, you must contact Expedia’s group travel specialists by phone at (800) 916-3290 or by filling out the group travel form online. One of our group travel specialists will research your request and contact you to complete your reservation. You may be asked to sign a written contract and/or pay a nonrefundable deposit. <br><br>
		Some hotel suppliers may require you to present a credit card or cash deposit upon check-in to cover additional expenses incurred during your stay. Such deposit is unrelated to any payment received by Expedia, Inc. for your hotel booking. <br><br>
